# Publishing pages

Each page that is to be published on the website should contain (at least) the
5 lines on the top of this file, including the triple dashed line, at the top of
the file. Web pages should be submitted in the `_pages` directory to prevent
clutter, and should be in MarkDown (`.md`) format.

## Keywords:

 - title: Page title as shown in the menu
 - permalink: permalink to the page, e.g. setting this to /pagename will set the
	 page URL to rse-cambridge.github.io/pagename
 - menu: set this to `true` to show a page in the web menu, false to keep it
	 hidden

## WIP
This is all work in progress and subject to change.
